		<P STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.11in">While there are many ways to use the
			results of the Checklists, one important strategy is to collaborate
			with the individual with developmental disabilities to create goals
			and measure success.  One method is to use <I>Goal Attainment Scaling</I>
			(Kiresuk &amp; Sherman, 1968)<SUP>1</SUP> or GAS.

		<P STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>What is Goal Attainment Scaling?</B>
		</P>
			
		<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a
			personalized method for setting and evaluating progress toward
			specific objectives. Unlike traditional goal-setting techniques, GAS
			allows users to define their own <B>baseline and levels of
			achievement</B>, ensuring that progress is <B>meaningful and
			individualized</B>. The approach is particularly useful in
			healthcare, caregiving, research, and personal development.
		</P>
		
		<P STYLE="margin-top: 0in;margin-bottom: 0.11in"><B>How Does It Work?</B></P>
		
		<P STYLE="margin-top: 0in;margin-bottom: 0.11in">Users start by identifying a <B>target
			goal</B> and setting a range of outcomes from <B>-2 (significantly
			below expectation)</B> to <B>+2 (exceeding expectation)</B>. This
			scaling system provides a clear way to assess improvement,
			challenges, and successes over time.
