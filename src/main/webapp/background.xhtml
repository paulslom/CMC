				a previous project for the American Occupational Therapy Association
				(AOTA), Anne Dickerson and Elin Schold Davis created an Occupational
				Therapy Checklist for Community Mobility (OTCCM) specifically for
				older adults who were no longer able to drive.  Using this paper
				model, Dr. Dickerson proposed creating three checklists for three
				general categories of individuals:  Individuals with primarily
				intellectual disabilities, individuals with primarily physical
				disabilities, and autistic individuals. Incorporating technology, she
				and her team designed each Checklists to "match" the
				various types of community mobility (other than driving) to the
				unique strengths and challenges of individuals with disabilities.

			<FONT FACE="Aptos, serif">Ultimately,
				the Checklists were designed by Dr. Dickerson and her doctoral
				student, Ellee Hopkins, with expert feedback from Dr. Miriam Monahan.
				 The Checklists were drafted and revised based on expert review by a
				group of occupational therapists who work directly with one or more
				the three populations.
