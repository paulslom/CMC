				a previous project for the American Occupational Therapy Association
				(AOTA), Anne Dickerson and Elin Schold Davis created an <I>Occupational
				Therapy Checklist for Community Mobility </I> (OTCCM) (Schold Davis &amp; Dickerson, 2017) specifically for
				older adults who were no longer able to drive.  Using this paper
				model, Dr. Dickerson proposed creating three checklists for three
				general categories of individuals:  Individuals with primarily
				intellectual disabilities, individuals with primarily physical
				disabilities, and autistic individuals. Incorporating technology, she
				and her team designed each Checklists to "match" the
				various types of community mobility (other than driving) to the
				unique strengths and challenges of individuals with disabilities.

				 The Checklists were drafted and revised based on expert review by a

				the three populations.

			    An international group of occupational therapists with expertise in driving and/or autism are collaborating to enhance the Mobility Checklist for Autism. 
			    In addition to Anne Dickerson, the other collaborators include Drs. Barbara Mazer and Isabelle GÃ¨linas from Canada, Dr. Carolyn Unsworth from Australia, 
			    and Dr. Miriam Monahan from the United States. Our goal is to use a Delphi method for consensus on the choice and wording of the skill items 
			    and matching to the types of transportation. There will be several iterations with therapists who routinely work with autistic individuals on community mobility.  
			    Once complete, the checklist will be updated and published in an appropriate journal.
